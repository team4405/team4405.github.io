##Partnering With Us

In order to continue our success, we need partners in the community for the 2014 season. The FIRST basic kit of parts is $5,000 and that is only the half of our budget. We have to plan for the added cost of materials, custom made parts, marketing/promotional items (t-shirts, banner, brochure printing, website, etc.), and transportation. Funding is our main priority for now, but anything you can contribute is greatly appreciated.

##Our Sponsorship Details

All the Sponsors names will be announced at the competitions. We are proud to promote our partners based on the amount of your contribution or value of items/materials donated*.

*Items/materials will be categorized as far as possible based on our cost of similar item/materials, but the final decision is up to us.

**For logo and company name placement, payment is required by January 15, 2014
