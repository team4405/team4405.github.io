###Our Team
We are a growing team from Plymouth Christian Academy. The 2016 season will be our fifth year of competition in the FIRST Robotics program. In our first year, we won the Hotshot Rookie Award; and in our second year we were only three places away from going to the state championships. Our third year we played very well and were district finalists at the Livonia competitions. This past year, we not only made it to states, but we also qualified for the World Championship in St. Louis! With your help, we have a very good chance of making it all the way the championships again this year.

###Our School
Plymouth Christian Academy is a non-denominational, college preparatory Christian school. Since 1976, our preschool, kindergarten, elementary, and secondary programs have provided a quality education designed to advance each student in four areas: spiritual, academic, social, and physical.
