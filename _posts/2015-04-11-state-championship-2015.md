We had lots of fun in Grand Rapids this weekend at the FIM State Championship. Along with lots of Recycle Rush, the governor Rick Snyder and FIRST founder Dean Kamen came by and signed our banners from our previous District events. Thank you Mr. Snyder for supporting FIRST Robotics and "Making it Loud"! We played very well, especially in our last few matches and despite not getting picked, we still preformed well enough in the qualification matches to make it to the World Championship! St. Louis, here we come!
